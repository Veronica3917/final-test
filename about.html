            <a href="/"><p>Website of photographs and information of the bronze heads in the the Old Summer Palace.</p></a>
            <p>The copper used is an alloy made especially for the palace and contains many precious metals, the same copper used in the bronze cranes on display in the Forbidden City and Summer Palace in Beijing, with a deep colour and a fine inner light that has survived the elements without rusting. Interestingly, the bronze heads of the zodiac were made by Chinese court craftsmen and designed by artists from Europe, such as Lang Shining; the bronze statues are therefore both rich in traditional Chinese aesthetic interest and a blend of Western plastic arts.More importantly, they are a cultural legacy of Chinese people for thousands of years and a symbol of the strength of China in those days. </p>
