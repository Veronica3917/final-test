After the Old Summer Palace was looted and burned by British and French troops in 1860, the pig's head was sent overseas.

In 1987, it was purchased by an American museum. In 2003, the famous entrepreneur Dr. Stanley Ho invested in the purchase and donated it to the Poly Art Museum for collection, which finally returned to China. As for the amount of money paid, Poly side did not disclose, is said to be less than 7 million Hong Kong dollars. It is currently housed in the Poly Art Museum.
