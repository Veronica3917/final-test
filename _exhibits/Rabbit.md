The Rabbit Bronze Head has the same fate as the Rat Bronze Head. After "burning the Old Summer Palace" in 1860, it was looted and lost overseas. In 2009, it appeared in the Yves Saint Laurent's special auction held by Christie's Auction Company in France. The buyer Cai Mingchao submitted a bid for the Rabbit Head that was auctioned for 14 million euros, but Mingchao Cai refused to pay to boycott the purchase of cultural relics.
