After the Old Summer Palace was looted and burned by Anglo-French forces in 1860, the Ox head has been living abroad, and it appeared once in an American house as the garden decoration.

In the 1980s, Taiwanese entrepreneur Cai Chennan bought the Ox head at the auction at Sotheby's, June 1989. On April 30, 2000, China Poly Group Corp. purchased the Ox head at Christie's in Hong Kong for USD $0,98 million, and it is now stored in the Poly Art Museum, Beijing.
