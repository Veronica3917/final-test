In 1860, after the Old Summer Palace was looted and burned by Anglo-French forces, the Rat Bronze Head has been living abroad, and then it appeared in a French museum for a brief exhibition with the Rabbit Bronze Head. The Rat Head was originally a bronze statue and was part of a water clock fountain in front of the Haiyantang building of the Xiyang Building, Old Summer Palace. After "burning the Old Summer Palace" in 1860, it was looted and lost overseas. In 2009, it appeared in the Yves Saint Laurent's special auction held by Christie's Auction Company in France. At 3:07 on February 26, 2009, Beijing time, the Rat head was auctioned for 14 million euros. The buyer was Cai Mingchao, who is the chairman and general manager of Xiamen XINHE Art Auction Co., and consultant of the China Rescue and Lost Overseas Cultural Relics Special Fund Collection. However, he later refused to pay in order to boycott the trade of cultural relics.

Eventually, in 2013, the Rat Bronze Head and the Rabbit Bronze Head were bought by the Pinault family, who own French luxury group Kering and donated to the Chinese government. The Rat Bronze Head is currently in the collection of the National Museum of China, Beijing.
