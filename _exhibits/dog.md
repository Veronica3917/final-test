According to a report by The World Journal on April 27, 2009, [10] Andy Zheng, a Chinese living in Front Royal, Virginia, said that he bought a bronze statue of a dog's head at a thrift store for 1,000 US dollars a month ago. Judging from its appearance, material and size, He thought it was probably the dog's head, one of the 12 animal heads. The bronze statue of the dog's head is about 40cm high, and the base is about 18cm x 18cm. The bronze statue weighs about 9.5kg. It is painted black and has fine hair lines on the dog's head. The water inlet is still visible under the base, but the outlet at the dog's head is not. The owner of the thrift store said the statue was consigned from an unknown source and the seller asked for $1,000, not even a cent less. Andy Cheng decided to buy it after careful consideration. Andy Cheng said it would be nice if the lost national treasure could return to the motherland, but he has neither the money nor the opportunity to verify the identity of the dog head bronze statue. He hopes to attract the attention of cultural relics connoisseurs and collectors.
