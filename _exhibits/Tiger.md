After the Old Summer Palace was looted and burned by Anglo-French forces in 1860, the Tiger head has been living abroad and appeared once in an American house as a garden decoration. In the 1980s, Taiwanese entrepreneur Cai Chennan bought the Tiger head at the auction at Sotheby's with the Ox head together. On May 2, 2000, China Poly Group Corp. purchased it from Sotheby's for USD $1,98 million, and it is now stored in the Poly Art Museum, Beijing.
